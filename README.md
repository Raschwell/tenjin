A spaced repetition application.
  * A daemon that notifies you if you have scheduled cards, and takes care of scheduling
        [to make reviews happen, I had to add anki to autostart, but that was rather awkward,
         took quite some time to start up, and left the possibility of same-day repetition out.
         random practice beats massed practice long term just as spaced-rep beats cramming...
         or so I've heard]
  * Trickling
        [based on weights you give to a list of items, and their difficulty, tries to give you a
         steady supply of cards, if you haven't manually added any today. E.g: word(s) of the day.
         main app should probably call editor to make cards better, than could be supplied by
         wikidictionary]
  * More customizeable card types (python scripts)
        [the classical flash-card approach supposedly works well for languages, poems, or trivia,
         but I, for one, would like to apply the benefits of spaced practice to more practical fields]
