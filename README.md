To be done
  * Trickling
     Automatically add cards from source if a low number of new cards have been added (to prevent fatigue, but with even   uneventful days being the equivalent of a x words a day platform)
  * Integration of pomodoros

  * Link to source, integration with document library.
     Link cards to annotations, websites,
