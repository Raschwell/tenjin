Database

Daemon
  Periodically check database items for anything scheduled
  Keep track of pomodoros, don't bug me if in one
  Trickling

Card viewer
  Quick-edit cards
  TeX
  Images
  Links to source
  Show hashtags at bottom
  Multiple questions/progressions
  Stuff with priority tags [like "math" or explicit "priority=fuckinghigh"] shoved to beginning of list
  Show cards left, w various priority tags. Do cards in priority chunks?

Quick Card Creator
  Call hotkey, create a card
  Add #hashtags
  Add to [topic]

Card selector(?) #May just be a trivial inconvenience, hashtags serve as topic markers. Cardviewer could order by them,too
  Select by type

Workflow:
  * Daemon bugs me
  * I hotkey start the card|topic selector, going down by topic{is this whole thing needed?}
  * Card selector calls cardviewer
  * Cardviewer reads data from db
  * Cardviewer events manipulate database
